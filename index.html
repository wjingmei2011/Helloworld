    <h2>Introducing Myself</h2>
    <p>I'm an adventurer, foodie, golf and tennis players, occasional follower of pop culture and celebrity gossips, oh! and a happy Mom of a border collie boy, Mochi (you can find his photos <a herf='https://www.instagram.com/mochi_border_collie/', target="_blank"> here </a> </p>
    <p>I'm originally from Sichuan, China (yes, very spicy food), studied/worked in Japan (Nara and Tokyo) and now a resident in California, US (you could probably tell from the picture above;). </p>

    <h2>What I'm reading these days</h2>
    <p>I'm reading this book recently: <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509', target="_blank"> The Phoenix Project</a>. It talks about DevOps management and is both informative and fun to read. I highly recommend it! </p> 
    <p>Other books I'm reading or have read recently and highly recommend: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How Computer Works - it explains very complicated concepts in a clear way, with lots of illustrative images that are very helpful for beginners like myself to grasp the nuts and bolts of how computer hardware and software work. </li>
